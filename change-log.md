## 2026-06-03 — Refactor Profiles onto one Metric abstraction; traits = features

- **What:**
  - **Shared `Metric` model** (`web-next/src/lib/metrics.ts`, unit-tested): a Metric is
    anything measurable per-player *and* per-game with a good/bad direction. Features and
    traits are both just Metrics — `featureGroups` (by category) and `traitGroups` (a
    trait roll-up *lead* column + its member features) produce the same shape, plus a
    shared `playerPrefix` (Pts/TPR/Resil/Conv) and `metricRange`/`groupRanges` for colour.
  - **One generic `MetricMatrix`** (replaces `Matrix` *and* `TraitMatrix`) and **one
    `PlayerBreakdown`** (replaces `PlayerGames` *and* `TraitPlayerGames`). The temperament
    view is now literally the feature framework: **red→green** `cellColor` (dropped the
    diverging palette here), identical column/width treatment, **every value column sorts
    desc on click** (the focused trait/feature sorts the field), and the player drill is
    the **same round-ordered per-game table with a Mean row**. Trait columns expand to
    their member features; the trait *lead* is a field-relative z (green = more of the
    trait), members keep their own direction.
  - **Temperament in Insights:** `Winning DNA` and the correlation matrix each gained a
    **Temperaments / Features** toggle. New `traitResultCorr` (each trait's Pearson r with
    the game result) and `traitCorrMatrix` (trait×trait r) computed on the frontend from
    per-game trait z (`pearson` helper, unit-tested).
  - Deleted `Matrix.tsx`, `TraitMatrix.tsx`, `PlayerGames.tsx`, `TraitPlayerGames.tsx`.
- **Why:** the user wanted the trait view to *be* the feature view (same palette, same
  round-sorted breakdown, same sortable/width treatment) and traits surfaced in Insights —
  and, above all, the duplication between the feature path and the trait path collapsed
  into one abstraction. Now a single Metric drives matrix, breakdown, ranges and colour for
  both. `run_tests.sh` + web-next vitest (31) green; verified live via CDP (clicked a
  player → round-sorted trait breakdown; opened Insights → trait Winning-DNA + trait
  correlation matrix).

## 2026-06-03 — Profiles: temperament matrix replaces the radar + app-wide selection persistence

- **What:**
  - **Field-relative trait aggregation** (`web-next/src/lib/traits.ts`, unit-tested):
    the same 6 behavioural traits as the Form heatmap, but z-scored against the **field**
    (mean/std of player means per feature) instead of a player's own baseline — so
    players can be *ranked* on a trait ("most aggressive in this tournament"). Exposes
    `availableTraits`, `fieldFeatStats`, `traitTable` (players × traits + member z), and
    `gameTraitZ` (a single game scored on the same normaliser).
  - **Temperament matrix** (`components/TraitMatrix.tsx`) **replaces the player radar**:
    players × 6 traits, each cell a diverging field-z (warm = more of the trait). Trait
    columns **expand** to their member features; clicking any header **focuses + sorts**
    the field by it; clicking a player opens **`TraitPlayerGames`** — that player's games
    ranked most→least of the focused trait, members alongside. A per-row checkbox feeds
    the Phase & colour comparison (the radar's old job). `PlayerRadar.tsx` removed.
  - **App-wide selection persistence:** the selected **player** is lifted to `App` and
    shared by Profiles *and* Form, and the Profiles UI (slice, focused feature/trait,
    expanded traits, comparison set, open drill) is lifted into one `ProfUi` bundle
    (`lib/profile.ts`). Because this state lives above the view boundary, it survives tab
    switches **and** opening a game and coming back — the player stays selected and the
    drill stays open. `FormView` is now controlled by the shared player.
- **Why:** the radar made you hand-pick players and squint at overlapping polygons; it
  never answered "who is the most X, and which of their games show it." The trait matrix
  makes that a sort-and-click. And selections used to reset on every tab switch / game
  open — now they persist, as requested. `run_tests.sh` + web-next vitest (22) green;
  verified live (headless screenshots of Profiles + Form on the Candidates Open field).

---

## 2026-06-03 — Form view: temperament heatmap (cluster traits, round by round)

- **What:**
  - **New behavioural clustering** (`web-next/src/lib/temperament.ts`): folds the ~38
    raw features into **6 temperament traits** that cut *across* the positional headings
    — Aggression, Risk appetite, Caution, Technical craft, Structure discipline,
    Composure. Each declares member features with a sign that aligns them to the trait
    (e.g. islands/isolated/doubled are inverted for Structure discipline). Pure +
    unit-tested (`temperament.test.ts`, 7 tests): z-scoring with a std floor, sign
    alignment, cluster = mean of available members, diverging colour.
  - **Temperament heatmap** (`components/TemperamentHeatmap.tsx`): rows = traits ×
    columns = rounds, each cell coloured by how dialled-up/down that trait was versus the
    player's *own* tournament baseline (signed z-score; warm oxblood = amplified, cool
    deep-blue = damped). Result+opponent strip on top; rows expand to their member
    features; clicking a cell opens that game.
  - **`FormView` rebuilt** to lead with the heatmap, then a focused drill-down (line
    chart + after-result / vs-stronger conditioning + round table) for whichever
    trait/feature row is selected. Removed the old one-feature-at-a-time dropdown flow;
    dropped a setState-in-effect by deriving the active player.
- **Why:** the Form view forced you to dropdown through 38 features one at a time and you
  could never see a player's tournament arc as a whole. The heatmap shows the *emotional
  arc* in one glance (e.g. "after the R5 loss, Risk spiked and Composure dropped") with
  the raw features still one click away. Verified live (headless screenshot of the
  Candidates Open field); `run_tests.sh` + web-next vitest green.

## 2026-06-02 — Fix EVAL accuracy spikes (clamp) + render robustness/perf

- **What:**
  - **EVAL accuracy bug:** centipawn loss was uncapped, so in already-decided positions the
    engine's wild eval swings logged huge phantom "errors" — e.g. Keymer vs Vidit, eval +59.72
    → +16.72 pawns scored as a **4300cp blunder**, blowing `EVAL.consistency` to 547. Now evals
    are **clamped to ±10 pawns** before the per-move loss (standard ACPL practice). Keymer's
    accuracy went acpl 88→11.5, consistency 547→25. Test added; profiles rebuilt.
  - **Render robustness:** added an **ErrorBoundary** around the active view, so a render error
    shows a message and stays recoverable instead of unmounting the whole app to a blank screen.
  - **Perf:** the Insights **drawer now mounts its heatmap lazily** (first open), so the 38×38
    correlation grid no longer renders on every profile load — meaningful for the 116-player
    Grand Swiss (5.5 MB) profile.
- **Why:** Debugging a reported "EVAL.consistency jumps 30→500 in a move" surfaced the
  decisive-range ACPL flaw. The blank-screen report traced to grand-swiss being heavy to render
  (no crash on women/candidates — those are fine on a fresh load; a stale cached bundle was the
  likely culprit there); the error boundary + lazy drawer harden against both.

## 2026-06-01 — Grand Swiss eval annotated (full coverage)

- **What:** Ran `annotate_eval.py` over all 638 Grand Swiss games (~80 min local Stockfish);
  `EVAL.acpl`/`EVAL.consistency` now available there too (it's a clockless event, so only
  `%eval` was added, no `%clk`). Rebuilt profiles; `profiles.test` updated (EVAL available for
  both fields). Grand-Swiss profile JSON is now ~5.5 MB (eval + cross + per-game phase data for
  116 players; ~1 MB gzipped, lazy-loaded per tournament).
- **Why:** Completes eval coverage so accuracy/tilt analysis works across the full corpus, not
  just the Candidates.

## 2026-06-01 — Form & Temperament layer + local Stockfish eval pass

- **What:**
  - **Form & Temperament view** (`web-next`, new Form tab `#form/<slug>`): per-player tournament
    arc from existing data — a feature's form curve across rounds (result-coloured points + a
    clickable result strip into the stepper), temperament conditioned by **entering streak**
    (after a win/draw/loss/**2+ losses**) and **opponent strength** (vs stronger/weaker) as
    diverging bars vs the player's mean (good/bad coloured by feature direction), and a
    round-by-round table. Pure `lib/form.ts` + vitest. No backend/engine.
  - **Local Stockfish eval pass** (`scripts/annotate_eval.py`): drives Stockfish 18 (depth-12,
    free) over each game, writing `[%eval]` into move comments (keeping `%clk`), so
    `EVAL.acpl` / `EVAL.consistency` compute. `build_profiles` now auto-detects eval. Annotated
    both **Candidates** sections; profiles rebuilt → EVAL is a real, capability-gated feature
    (Candidates on, Grand Swiss off). It flows everywhere incl. the Form selector, giving
    **accuracy-by-round / accuracy-after-a-loss** (the rigorous tilt signal) — e.g. Esipenko's
    centipawn loss spikes on his losses but is *lower* after a loss (bounce-back, not tilt).
- **Why:** Reframes the project toward the real goal ([[end-goal-player-dynamics]]) — form,
  temperament, and how players shift vs opponents / after results — most of it from data we
  already had, with eval (free, local) adding the quality/tilt dimension. Grand Swiss eval is a
  separate longer batch (run annotate_eval.py per slug).

## 2026-06-01 — Sustained material deficit/lead (filter trade blips)

- **What:** `MAT.deficit` / `MAT.lead` now only count a material gap that **persists ≥4 plies
  (~2 moves)**, via a rolling window in `MoveAssembler` (worst deficit = largest gap whose
  window-minimum stays in the red). A capture–recapture or pending recapture no longer
  registers as a deficit/lead. Resilience/Conversion recompute on the sustained values;
  the **Comeback/Collapse columns are dropped** (weak signal). Descriptions updated, profiles
  rebuilt, even-trade test added.
- **Why:** The per-ply max sampled mid-trade intermediates, so an ongoing/just-resolved trade
  handed out false "was behind/ahead" credit. The effect was large — e.g. Caruana's mean worst
  deficit fell 4.36 → 0.86 once blips are filtered, i.e. the old number was ~5× trade noise.
  Honest consequence: sustained ≥3 material deficits are rare at elite level, so Resil/Conv are
  sparse for the Candidates (meaningful mainly on amateur/Swiss data) — correct, not a bug.
  The remaining gap (sound sacrifice vs real deficit / compensation) needs the SEE+eval tier.

## 2026-06-01 — Fight & defence features + Game-view backend on by default

- **What:**
  - **New backend features** (assembler + `catalog/move.py`, 38 total now): `MAT.deficit`
    (worst material a side fell behind, running max), `MAT.lead` (most ahead), `MAT.on_board`
    (total material left, min = most simplified), `TIM.trouble` (moves made under a minute,
    CLOCK-gated). They flow into the matrix / breakdown / correlation / phase slices for free.
  - **Fight & defence record** (`fightStats` in `lib/profile.ts`, derived on the frontend from
    per-game `MAT.deficit`/`MAT.lead` + result): **Resilience** (% of games behind ≥3 not
    lost), **Conversion** (% of games ahead ≥3 won), **Comebacks**, **Collapses** — added as
    sortable leading columns in the Profiles matrix (sort by Resil to find the best defenders).
  - **Game view defaults to Backend on**, so the MOVE/CLOCK/EVAL features (initiative,
    prophylaxis, deficit, time-trouble, …) compute on the stepper, not just board features.
  - Regenerated `features.yaml`; rebuilt profiles; updated registry/manifest/api counts (38)
    and added assembler tests (deficit/lead/on_board, time-trouble).
- **Why:** First tranche of the "free, high-reward" feature ideas — turns material-trajectory
  + result into a real *fight & defence* read (who falls behind and saves it, who converts,
  who collapses) at near-zero cost from data we already had.

## 2026-06-01 — `DEV.tempo_waste` only counts in the opening

- **What:** Tempo waste was counting "re-moving a developed minor / early queen" on *every*
  ply, so a knight repositioning in the middlegame or endgame inflated it — nonsensical, since
  tempo loss is an opening concept. Now the increment is **gated to the opening phase**.
  - Extracted `classify_phase`/`is_opening` into a new neutral `chesslab/phase.py` (the
    assembler can't import the orchestrator — circular); `orchestrator` re-exports
    `classify_phase` for back-compat.
  - `MoveAssembler` increments `tempo_waste` only when the position before the move
    `is_opening(...)`. Updated the feature's description/computation; rebuilt profiles.
  - Test: a knight-shuffle game — extending the shuffle past move 12 no longer raises the count.
- **Why:** Direct fix to a reported false signal; a developed-piece re-route mid-game is normal
  play, not wasted time.

## 2026-06-01 — Drawer width, frozen heatmap labels, uncapped focus list (web-next)

- **What:**
  - **Wider Insights drawer** (660 px) so nearly all feature columns of the correlation
    heatmap are visible at once; handle stays pinned to the panel edge.
  - **Frozen feature-name column** in the heatmap (`position: sticky; left: 0`) so the row
    labels stay readable while scrolling the grid.
  - **Focus panel uncapped:** the per-feature player ranking (the rail card that updates when a
    matrix column is clicked) now lists **all** players high→low and scrolls, its height
    bounded to the matrix (~68 vh). (This is the cap the earlier "don't cap at 8" meant.)
- **Why:** Direct UI feedback — the heatmap was too cramped to read and lost its labels on
  scroll; and the clicked-feature ranking should show the whole field ordered, not a top-8
  slice. web-next only; build + Vitest green.

## 2026-06-01 — Insights drawer, feature-correlation matrix, ungate, layout rework

- **What:**
  - **Right-edge drawer** (`RightDrawer`): a chevron **handle** peeks at the edge — hover to
    reveal, click to pin. **Winning DNA** moved into it, plus a new **feature-correlation
    heatmap**.
  - **Feature↔feature correlation** (`aggregate.FeatureCorrelationMatrix`, a small OOP value
    object): pairwise Pearson over per-(player,game) observations → `feature_correlation`
    `{features, r[][]}` in the profile. `CorrelationMatrix` renders a green(+1)→red(−1) grid.
  - **Ungated:** the phase×colour `cross` and per-game `phase_vals` are now **always emitted**
    (removed the field-size gate); `_rollup_doc` simplified. Grand-Swiss JSON ~4.9 MB
    (~0.8 MB gz, lazy-loaded); Candidates ~430 KB.
  - **Layout:** the per-feature player ranking (`FocusPanel`) moved up to the rail (Winning DNA
    left it); the **per-game breakdown now sits in the matrix column** (matching its width);
    the **player radar lost its 8-player cap** and its picker is a scrollable bordered box.
    Chart `PALETTE` already warm/earthy.
  - Tests: `FeatureCorrelationMatrix` unit (perfect/inverse/diagonal/min-n); profiles.test.mjs
    asserts the matrix is square/symmetric/diagonal-1/in-range and cross+phase_vals always on.
- **Why:** Winning DNA is reference material, not a constant-on panel — a drawer reclaims the
  width for the matrix while keeping it a hover away; the correlation heatmap answers "which
  features say the same thing" (redundancy / style structure); and removing the gate honours
  "always keep phase-wise on" so the drill-down tracks the filter for every tournament.

## 2026-06-01 — Phase filter now drives the per-game breakdown

- **What:** The Opening/Middlegame/Endgame filter previously moved the matrix, takeaway,
  Winning DNA and radar but **not** the per-game breakdown (it showed whole-game values) — so
  it looked like the filter was broken there. Now the breakdown is phase-aware:
  - `aggregate.tournament_profile` emits per-game **`phase_vals`** (the game's per-phase value
    per feature), **gated to cross-eligible / small dense fields** like the cross (Candidates
    yes; Grand Swiss keeps whole-game only, with a caption, to bound JSON size).
  - `PlayerGames` reads the current phase's per-game value, recomputes the **Mean** from it
    (so it still reconciles with the phase-sliced matrix), and colours cells against the
    **same slice's** field range. Caption shows "· Endgame only" (or notes whole-game where
    per-phase data isn't stored). New `test_aggregate` checks (present + reconciles; dropped on
    sparse fields).
- **Why:** Direct fix to the reported "filter isn't working" — the matrix and the drill-down
  now move together under the phase filter, and the Mean still equals the matrix value. Rebuilt
  profiles (Candidates ~424 KB; Grand Swiss unchanged ~2 MB).

## 2026-06-01 — Drill-down → game deep link + heatmap colour fix (web-next)

- **What:**
  - **Click a breakdown row → open that game in the stepper** (`App.openGame` switches to the
    Game view, loads the game's tournament, and sets `#<id>@0`). Opponent names are dotted-
    underlined as the affordance.
  - **Fixed the breakdown heatmap going blue/purple:** `cellColor` now **clamps** goodness to
    [0,1]. The matrix colours by the field's *mean* range, but a single game's value can exceed
    any player's mean → goodness > 1 → the `hsl(g·120°)` hue ran past green into cyan/blue/
    purple. Clamping keeps the breakdown on the same red→green scale as the matrix.
  - **Retired off-theme chart colours:** the categorical `PALETTE` (radar / trajectory) dropped
    the purple/indigo for warm earthy tones; White (oxblood) and Black (deep blue) still lead.
- **Why:** Direct response to feedback — the drill-down's colours diverged from the main table
  (the clamp bug) and the radar used purple that clashed with the warm theme; and being able to
  jump from a suspicious per-game number straight into the move-by-move stepper closes the
  "this looks off → see why" loop. web-next only; build + Vitest green.

## 2026-06-01 — Player per-game drill-down (Profiles)

- **What:** Clicking a player name in the Profiles matrix now opens a **per-game breakdown**
  in the space between the matrix and the player radar: one row per game (round · opponent ·
  W/D/L · colour), every feature a column (colour-coded vs the field, like the matrix), and a
  bold **Mean** row that equals that player's value in the matrix above. Respects the colour
  filter (filters to White/Black games so the mean still reconciles); notes when a phase
  filter is active that per-game values are whole-game.
  - **Data:** `aggregate.tournament_profile` now emits `game_rows` per player (id, round,
    colour, opponent, result, score, and per-feature whole-game values, 2 dp). Rebuilt all
    profiles. New `test_aggregate` check that the per-game values' mean reconciles with the
    rollup mean.
  - **web-next:** new `PlayerGames` component; matrix player names are clickable + highlight.
- **Why:** The matrix shows one number per player·feature with no way to see how it was
  reached — a club player can't tell a consistent trait from one outlier game. The breakdown
  is the "show your work" that makes each cell trustworthy and turns "scan the field" into
  "study a player". Note: Grand-Swiss profile JSON grows to ~2 MB (per-game data; ~300 KB
  gzipped, lazy-loaded per tournament); Candidates ~230 KB.

## 2026-06-01 — `web-next/` full parity with the vanilla app (Game view + Profiles charts)

- **What:** Ported every remaining piece of `web/` into the React/TS spike.
  - **Engine reuse:** copied `engine.js / parser.js / highlights.js / catalog.js / analysis.js /
    pieces.js / api.js` verbatim into `src/engine/` (typed via `allowJs`); pinned **chess.js
    0.10.3** (the parser's API) so offline feature math can't drift from the canonical engine.
    Typed wrapper `engine/game.ts` exposes `analyzeQuick`/`analyzeBackend`.
  - **Game view** (`GameView` + `components/game/*`): board (cburnett SVG, move + feature
    highlights), ←/→ stepper + counter, category-grouped feature table (per-side values, coloured
    deltas, favour tally), explanation panel ("why it changed"), both-sides trend chart, running
    aggregates + plain reading, round/game picker, custom-PGN paste, **Backend toggle** with
    auto-fallback to offline. Fixes the "table didn't sort / no charts" gaps.
  - **Profiles charts:** added the **player radar** (clustered ≤8 feats/≤8 players), **phase &
    colour** card (trajectory / fingerprint heatmap / White-vs-Black radars), and the **feature
    scatter** — completing parity with the redesigned matrix/Winning-DNA/focus layout.
  - **App shell:** Game/Profiles tabs, shared tournament selector, deep-link hash routing
    (`#profiles/<slug>`, `#<id>@<ply>`). Central Chart.js registration (`lib/chartSetup`).
    `sync-data` now also mirrors `../web/data/t/*` (PGNs). Build + Vitest green.
- **Why:** The first spike only had the Profiles matrix; the user asked to carry over the finer
  touches (sortable table, radar plots, the game stepper, …) so `web-next` is a true side-by-side
  replacement for the `:8000` app to evaluate the migration. Reusing the engine modules keeps the
  parity wall intact — React only owns the view shell.

## 2026-05-30 — `web-next/` Profiles UX redesign (insight-first layout)

- **What:** Reworked the spike from stacked full-width sections into a two-column
  "instrument", giving space in proportion to value:
  - **Takeaway sentence** (`takeaway()`) auto-derived from result-correlation top movers
    ("winners showed more Trade discipline and King-pawn shield; In check and Move time
    tracked losses"), phase-aware.
  - **Matrix as hero** with **category group headers** (Material/Space/King safety/…),
    sortable, sticky header + player column, click-to-focus.
  - **Insight rail:** **Winning DNA** — top ↑/↓ features as compact diverging bars
    (`topMovers()`), replacing the full-height 30-bar chart (now behind a "Show all
    features" toggle); **Focus panel** — the clicked feature's meaning + ranked players
    (`rankedEntries()`).
  - New pure helpers in `lib/profile.ts` (`featuresByCategory`, `rankedEntries`,
    `topMovers`, `takeaway`, `CATEGORY_LABEL`); build + Vitest green.
- **Why:** The "What wins" chart ate ~900px for an answer that's really "the top few
  features" — poor signal-per-pixel — and full-width stacking buried the matrix (the actual
  scan surface). For a club player trying to *understand and improve*, the redesign leads
  with the narrative (takeaway), makes the style-scan the hero, distills "what matters" into
  a glanceable panel, and gives every matrix column a purpose (focus → meaning + ranking).

## 2026-05-30 — `web-next/` frontend spike (Vite + React + TS + Tailwind + TanStack)

- **What:** New `web-next/` proof-of-concept (the existing `web/` is untouched). Ports the
  Profiles **overview matrix** (TanStack Table — sortable, colour-coded, sticky, click-to-focus),
  the **phase + colour filter bar**, and the **What-wins feature↔result correlation** chart
  (react-chartjs-2), on Vite 6 + React 19 + strict TypeScript + Tailwind v4 with the project
  design tokens. Typed profile contract (`types.ts`), pure view-logic (`lib/profile.ts`) with
  **Vitest** unit tests (7 passing), `sync-data` script mirroring `../web/data` (git-ignored).
  Build green (399 kB JS / 128 kB gz; CSS 3.4 kB gz). Pinned Vite to 6 because 7/8 (rolldown)
  need Node 22.12+ (local is 22.9).
- **Why:** The user asked to *feel* the difference between the hand-rolled vanilla UI and a
  modern component stack before deciding on a migration. The spike shows the headline wins —
  the matrix's sort/sticky/virtualization-ready behaviour, declarative chart lifecycle (kills
  the destroy/recreate bug class), compile-checked data, and testable view-logic — at the cost
  of a build step (gives up §11 "openable as a static file"). Kept side-by-side so both run.

## 2026-05-30 — Profiles: game-phase & colour dimensions + what-wins correlation

- **What:**
  - **Phase axis.** `orchestrator.classify_phase(board, ply)` tags every ply
    `opening|middlegame|endgame` (material+move hybrid: tapered `1·minors+2·rooks+4·queens`,
    start 24; opening = move ≤12 & ≥20, endgame = ≤8, else middlegame). `summarize` applies
    each feature's reducer *within* each phase (`FeatureCell.phase_values`); rollups now carry
    `phases:{…:{mean,n}}`.
  - **Colour axis.** Colour marginals promoted to `mean_white/black` + `n_white/n_black`.
  - **Phase × colour cross**, hybrid by field size: full 6-cell `cross` stored only for small
    dense fields (`emit_cross`: Candidates yes, Grand Swiss no); SPA falls back to the phase
    marginal ("approx") where absent.
  - **What-wins correlation.** `result_correlation:{fid:{r,n,phases}}` — tournament-level
    Pearson r between each feature and the game result (win 1·draw 0.5·loss 0), overall + per
    phase. Answers "which features go with winning."
  - **Frontend.** A Phase + Colour **filter row** re-slices matrix/leaderboard/radar/scatter
    via one `sliceValue` accessor (per-slice min-n; client-side re-sort); a new **Phase &
    colour** card (phase-trajectory lines / phase-fingerprint heatmap / White-vs-Black radars)
    and a **What-wins** correlation bar chart.
  - Dropped the now-redundant `mean_won` (superseded by `result_correlation`); slice means at
    2 dp. Rebuilt all profiles. Tests: phase classifier + per-phase reducers (`test_orchestrator`
    /`test_aggregate`), marginals/cross/correlation shape (`profiles.test.mjs`, 641 checks).
- **Why:** A single whole-game mean hides *when* and *with which colour* a player shows a
  trait. Phase + colour slicing lets you see how a player navigates opening→endgame and
  White vs Black, and the result-correlation surfaces which style traits actually track wins
  in a field — all falling out of the generic reducer spine, no per-question code. Cross is
  field-size-gated so thin (n≈3–5) cells never masquerade as signal. Grand-Swiss JSON ~1.07MB
  (no cross; gzips ~180KB), lazy-loaded per tournament.

## 2026-05-30 14:06 IST — Profiles charts: fix scatter update, multi-radar over all features

- **What:**
  - Fixed the scatter (and radar) not updating: `drawScatter`/`drawRadars` now destroy the
    existing Chart.js instance before recreating (Chart.js refuses to mount onto an
    in-use canvas, so the change was silently no-op'ing).
  - Player radar now covers **all** features: they're clustered by category into groups of
    ≤8 (`CLUSTER_MAX`), rendered as **multiple radar plots** (Material·Space, King safety,
    Structure, Development·Activity, Dynamics·Tactics·Decisions·Time). Up to 8 players can
    be selected; a shared colour legend spans the radars; min-n excluded from the
    normalization scale.
- **Why:** A single 8-axis radar hid most features, and the broken scatter looked frozen.
  Clustering shows every feature while keeping each radar readable, and the destroy-then-
  recreate is the correct Chart.js lifecycle.

## 2026-05-30 13:59 IST — Profiles depth: radar, scatter, feature description

- **What:**
  - **Player radar** — checkboxes pick players (top 3 by default); a Chart.js radar
    compares them across a curated 8-feature set (Space, Mobility, Coordination,
    Initiative, Prophylaxis, Tension-holding, King-zone pressure, Hanging), min-max
    normalized so outward = better (bad features inverted).
  - **Feature × feature scatter** — pick X/Y features; every qualified player a dot
    (Chart.js), tooltip names them. Defaults to Initiative × Prophylaxis.
  - **Feature description** now shown under the focused leaderboard (e.g. Space →
    "Territory you control in the opponent's half"); `description` added to the profile
    `meta` map and profiles rebuilt.
  - Charts reuse the already-loaded Chart.js; instances destroyed/recreated on re-render.
- **Why:** The matrix shows everything at once but flat; radar makes head-to-head player
  comparison legible, and the scatter exposes 2-D style planes (e.g. forcing vs
  prophylactic). The description answers "what does this metric mean?" in place.
- Remaining depth (next): opponent-Elo normalization toggle (off by default) + the
  DuckDB corpus store (queryable engine-of-record).

## 2026-05-30 12:15 IST — Profiles fixes: women data, scroll, value wrap

- **What:**
  - Removed `data/raw/candidates2026/women/round-14/` — it was a byte-for-byte duplicate
    of the Open round-14 games (the women's real round 14 isn't in the archive). Women is
    now a clean 13 rounds / 52 games / 8 players; rebuilt library + profiles (758 games).
  - Profiles matrix: clicking a column header no longer rebuilds the matrix — it updates
    the header highlight + the focused leaderboard in place (`focusFeature`), so the
    horizontal scroll position is preserved.
  - Leaderboard value (`.lbval`) is now single-line (`white-space:nowrap`, wider) so wide
    values like "15.54 ±5.43 n=13" no longer wrap and shift the row layout.
- **Why:** Switching to Candidates Women showed the 8 Open players "appended" — that was
  the misfiled round-14 surfacing; removing it fixes it at the source. The scroll reset
  and value-wrap were jarring interaction/layout bugs in the new matrix view.

## 2026-05-30 12:01 IST — Profiles overview matrix (all features at a glance)

- **What:** Reworked the Profiles view (`web/src/profiles.js`) from a single-feature
  leaderboard into an **overview matrix** — every player a row, every available feature a
  column, each cell colour-coded by the player's standing within that column (green good →
  red bad, respecting `higher`; neutral features uncoloured). Leading Pts/TPR columns,
  category-grouped feature columns with separators, sticky player column + header,
  horizontal/vertical scroll. Clicking a column header drills into that feature's ranked
  leaderboard (kept below). Min-n players shown faint and excluded from the colour scale.
- **Why:** Viewing one metric at a time buried the comparison; a player×feature heatmap
  lets you scan the whole field across all features at once and spot patterns (who's green
  on space but red on king safety, etc.). All client-side from the existing profile JSON —
  no data/backend change.

## 2026-05-30 11:45 IST — Tournament profiles (cross-player aggregation) — MVP

- **What:**
  - New `engine/chesslab/aggregate.py`: a generic **reducer spine** — each feature
    declares an `aggregation` (`end|mean|max|min|sum`, defaulted by scope); `summarize()`
    reduces a game's per-ply matrix to one value per (feature, side); `tournament_profile()`
    rolls players up (mean/stdev/95%-CI, by-colour/result, standings + linear TPR) and emits
    pre-sorted leaderboards. So "who is most X" = pick feature X.
  - `scripts/build_profiles.py` → `web/data/profiles/<slug>.json` (committed, lazy-loaded);
    `web/src/profiles.js` + a **Game / Profiles** tab (`#profiles/<slug>` deep-link) rendering
    a generic leaderboard (bars + n-badge + CI + min-n greying) and standings.
  - `FeatureMeta.higher`/`aggregation` now set on the Python board features and surfaced in
    the manifest (the Python manifest is authoritative for direction; clock→min, swing/
    move-time→max, density→mean, castle→max). Capability gating propagated to leaderboards
    (Grand Swiss/Norway `TIM.*` disabled; `EVAL.*` disabled everywhere).
  - Tests: `test_aggregate.py` (reducer resolution/summarize/rollup math) + `profiles.test.mjs`
    (shape, sort direction, gating, min-n). Suite green; mypy clean.
- **Why:** Answer tournament-wide, cross-player questions (most space, time trouble,
  prophylaxis, prepared, …) generically — a new feature flows into profiles for free.
  MVP-first (pure-Python → static JSON; DuckDB corpus store + radar/scatter/Elo-normalization
  are the planned depth, off by default). Known source-data issue: `women/round-14` holds the
  Open round-14 games (8 phantom 1-game "players" in the women profile; min-n keeps them off
  the leaderboards) — flagged for cleanup.

## 2026-05-30 10:24 IST — Multi-tournament library, data reorg, two-level filter

- **What:**
  - Reorganized `data/` into `raw/` (untouched source PGNs) and `tournaments/<slug>/`
    (generated per-round extracts). Added **FIDE Grand Swiss 2025** (638 games) and
    **Norway Chess 2026** (12) alongside the Candidates; moved `norway26.pgn` into `raw/`.
  - New `scripts/build_library.py` (replaces `build_candidates.py`) with a hardcoded
    `SOURCES` manifest → emits `web/data/library.json` (tournament index) + lazy-loaded
    `web/data/t/<slug>.json` per tournament. Game ids now `<slug>__r<RR>b<BB>`.
  - Frontend: **two cascading filters** — tournament · section → round · game — plus a
    Custom PGN option. **Removed the two built-in sample games.** Deep links use the new
    id format. CLAUDE.md §16 documents the layout, metadata schema, and id format.
  - Fixed a build bug: a reused `StringExporter` accumulated across games (440 MB blow-up)
    → fresh exporter per game.
- **Why:** Scale the games library beyond one tournament and make it navigable by the
  metadata that matters (tournament/section, then round/game), the way a user actually
  browses. Splitting index from per-tournament files keeps the initial load tiny while
  supporting hundreds of games. Removing samples makes the library the single source.

## 2026-05-30 10:14 IST — Fix CI install + change-log What/Why format

- **What:** `.github/workflows/tests.yml` now installs `.[dev,pipeline]` (was `.[dev]`).
  CLAUDE.md §15 updated to require an explicit **What** and **Why** per entry; existing
  entries reformatted to match.
- **Why:** GitHub Actions was failing — the suite gained backend/pipeline dependencies
  (`PyYAML` for `features.yaml` generation, `python-chess`/`fastapi` for the
  orchestrator/API tests), but CI only installed the `dev` extra, so imports failed.
  Verified the fix by running the suite in a clean venv with `python3` fallback (green).

## 2026-05-30 09:59 IST — MOVE / CLOCK / EVAL feature tier + change-log workflow

- **What:**
  - New MOVE features via `chesslab/assembly.py::MoveAssembler` (backend-only):
    `MAT.swing`, `TAC.exposure`, `DEV.tempo_waste`, `STR.tension_hold`,
    `DEC.trade_discipline` — with `DYN.initiative`/`TAC.density`/`DEC.prophylaxis`
    refactored into the same assembler.
  - CLOCK tier (`requires={CLOCK}`): `TIM.move_time` (`%emt`), `TIM.clock` (`%clk`).
    Pipeline parses `%emt`; the Candidates library JSON rebuilt **with comments** so
    clocks reach the backend.
  - EVAL scaffold (`requires={EVAL}`, gated): `EVAL.acpl`, `EVAL.consistency` from
    `%eval`. 34 features total; `FeatureMeta.higher` added. UI feature list scrolls
    within its column (sticky header). New `change-log.md`; CLAUDE.md §15 added.
- **Why:** Round out the feature catalog beyond the board tier — capture behavioral
  (initiative, prophylaxis, tension-holding) and time-usage signals that distinguish
  strong play, using the clocks already present in the Candidates PGNs. The change-log
  workflow was requested to track work and keep `origin/main` current.

## 2026-05-29 — Project baseline (initial commit `bc83ad8`)

- **What:** Engine-free positional feature engine (Python `chesslab`) + parity-tested JS
  mirror; feature registry + orchestrator → per-ply explainability JSON; FastAPI backend;
  `FileFeatureStore`. ~22 board-tier features (T0–T3) + 3 initial MOVE features. Frontend:
  registry-driven feature table, explanation panel, trend chart, comparison/favour tally,
  lichess cburnett pieces. 2026 FIDE Candidates library (112 games) with grouped picker +
  deep links. Automatic test suite + README; first push to GitHub.
- **Why:** Establish a reproducible, tested foundation for measuring chess *style* (how a
  player plays) rather than strength — on free public data, engine-minimal.
